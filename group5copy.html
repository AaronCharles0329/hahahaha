            <strong><i>Theme</i></strong>
            <strong>Emerging themes of cyberbullying</strong>

            <p>
                The researcher proposed that the principal theme that emerged from the open coding investigative process, which in-depth interviews provided, was that adolescents especially the bullies desired to gain ‘a sense of satisfaction’ over their lives and they
                found that this concept could be easily achieved by their use of online media applications. The imperative new categories that emerged from these interviews were.

                    <font color="gold"> The hard to remove cyberbullying incidents in cyberspace makes it remain for all to see even though it happens only once. The identification of these seven categories are the elements of the paradigm model of cyberbullying that was
                        never discussed prior to this study and therefore should be useful to add to the existing literature and for adolescents and stakeholders to have a better grip on the phenomenon in the Malaysian context.</font>

            <strong><i>program</i></strong>
            <p>
                Just when people thought bullying couldn’t get any worse, the world gave them social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. The birth of social media sites provided bullies with an innovative way to torment their targets – Cyberbullying. Cyberbullies
                victimize others through their smartphones, instant messaging, and other forms of communication technology. However, schools and counselors can prevent the occurrence of cyberbullying by adapting a school improvement program into their
                curriculum.
            </p>
            <p>

                Counselors should learn more about cyberbullying and encourage children to talk about their issues. Bullying usually occurs in school, but what can a school improvement program do to help kids who are bullied on social media sites? Just because it’s not
                happening on school grounds, doesn’t mean the issue is avoidable. Counselors can tackle this issue by incorporating the following measures into the program:

            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <font color="gold">Spread awareness amongst teachers, students, and parents.</font>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <font color="gold">Inform parents of different ways they can talk to their child about bullying and tell them to monitor their child’s internet usage at home.</font>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <font color="gold">Counselors can train the school staff to spot common signs of cyberbullying.</font>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <font color="gold">Counselors should encourage students and parents to keep proof of cyberbullying so that disciplinary actions can be taken.</font>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <font color="gold">Keep open communication with administrators, teachers, and parents.</font>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <font color="gold">After counselors have successfully implemented awareness, they can help the school set-up a bully prevention program for school effectiveness and school improvement.</font>
